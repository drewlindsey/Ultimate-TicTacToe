Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
Created by Drew Lindsey

This program is set up to automatically play a game of ultimate tic tac toe with a random AI bot.
To watch bots play each other, head to the source code and change the boolean value in the Player object at the top of the main to True
To play against another human, make sure both of the boolean values in the Player object are False

RULES:
First player begins by selecting any of the 81 available moves. The position in the small game board determines the position of the next game board you must play in. The game only allows
you to make appropriate moves. If the previous player sends the current player to a position that has already been won or has no remaining moves, then that player may play anywhere.
Gold boxes are available moves. If no gold boxes appear on screen then player may place move anywhere.

Good luck!
